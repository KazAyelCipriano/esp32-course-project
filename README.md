### Personal Project: ESP32 Soil Moisture Monitoring

In addition to the course material, this repository also includes a **Personal Project** folder dedicated to an **ESP32-based Soil Moisture Monitoring System**. This project is designed to demonstrate how to use the ESP32 to monitor and log soil moisture levels for agricultural or gardening purposes. 

The **Soil Moisture Monitoring** project folder contains:

- The schematic diagram for connecting the ESP32 to a soil moisture sensor.
- The program code used to read soil moisture levels and send the data via Wi-Fi to a remote server or display it on an LCD.
- Instructions on how to set up the system and calibrate the sensor for accurate readings.
- A simple web interface (if applicable) to monitor the soil moisture in real-time.

Feel free to explore this project and customize it to suit your own needs, whether for home gardening, farming, or environmental monitoring.
